### Exercise part 1

```{margin} Want to learn more about working with ilastik?
Check out the [documentation and tutorials list](https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/), or check them out on [the image.sc forum!](https://forum.image.sc/tag/ilastik)
```

- Today we will be following along with the excellent [ilastik pixel classifier tutorial](https://bit.ly/3x11EZf).  
  Let us know if you hit a snag!

- Some step

```{admonition} Question
:class: important

Questions to ask

### Exercise part 2

- Question to ask?  
  - If not, would that be a problem? Why or why not?

- Pay attention to how the segmentation changes as you add training
  data. Can you understand why it changes as it does? If not ask!

- We learned about this in the lecture - what exactly is this “random
  forest pixel classifier” doing behind the scenes? If it’s not clear,
  ask!

## **Bonus Exercises - Bonus 1**

- Pick the hardest image you’ve seen in the course (maybe the neuron images from Lab 2?) and try to segment it
  using the ilastik RF pixel classifier. Can you crack it? Can you
  understand why or why not?

---

## **Bonus Exercises - Bonus 2**

- Can you find an image segmentation or object classification problem
  that you *can’t* solve with ilastik? If you don’t have time to
  actually try it, can you think about what sort of problem might be
  unsolvable by any pixel classification approach?
