Segmentation
  Method of dividing an image into multiple parts or regions. There are three different types of segmentation. 
    - Semantic segmentation, where all parts of an image are part of a class, common in cell biology will be detecting cells and background on an image.
    - Instance segmentation, the segmentation is object based, not just detecting were the cells are but diving each cell as a separate object.
    - Panoptic Segmentation, it can be defined as a combination of the prior two, because it identifies the object but also classifies them. An example in biology might be detecting all the cells on an image and classifying them as dividing vs not.
