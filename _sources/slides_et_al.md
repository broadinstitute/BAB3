## Installation requirements

We asked before the course for you to install the following tools; if you have not already done so, please download Fiji right away, CellProfiler and CellProfiler Analyst before arriving on Tuesday, and Ilastik and QuPath before arriving on Wednesday.

- [ImageJ/Fiji](https://fiji.sc/)
- [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/)
- [CellProfiler Analyst](https://cellprofileranalyst.org/)
- [Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/)
- [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/)

Before Thursday, please install one of the following environment managers, if not already installed on your computer:
- [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/dev/installation/) (our recommendation) OR
- [Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html#automatic-install) (if you already have conda or mamba running on your machine, this is fine too)

Windows machine users -  you will also need to install the [Microsoft Build Tools](visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools)

Optionally, a container runner will also be used in one exercise but is not required:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (our recommendation if you're less computationally comfortable)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/) (our recommendation if you're more computationally comfortable)

## Slide decks and links to other materials

This table will be updated throughout the course with links to materials used during it. Links will be posted as soon as they are available; some activities will be live demos and as such may not have exact materials, but where possible we will try to post one or more relevant links.
